# Welcome to .tech that's internship community at GitHub.

**.tech that is our internal name for our Software Development team in the Test & DevOps hub og The Tech Collective.**

We're advocating and demonstrating a holistic approach to Software Developmetn. Our goal is to create **useful and innovative** tools, applications and features with quality built-in — as opposed to glued on.
